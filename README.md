# Ansible stuff

Ansible and configuration management is the way to do things faster and non-repetitive.
Consistency across the world. And in this case, in different with Chef and Puppet (that I love too) you donâ€™t need an agent!
What makes Ansible special is idempotency,

## Non-Idempotent Bash

* `echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts`

## Sample Idempotency Achieved in Bash


* `if (!grep -q 127.0.0.1 /etc/hosts); then echo "127.0.0.1 localhost" >> /etc/hosts; fi`

Thanks!
